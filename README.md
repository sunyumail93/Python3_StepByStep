# Python3_StepByStep
A step-by-step 10-day Python3 tutorial especially for bioinformatician

Codes:

Day1_ReadInput_ExecutablePython.py
* Read input using â€˜sys', and make the python script executable.

Day2_IfElse.py
* Solve the missing/extra input problem using if/else statement. Use internal function len(), print()

Day3_InputOutput.py
* Read a file, print, and write the first three columns of the first line to another new file.

Day4_TranslateFASTA.py
* Loop through a FASTA file containing CDS regions. Translate them into protein sequences using dictionary.

Day5_DebarcodeFASTQ_ByChuck.py
* Loop through a FASTQ file containing sequenced reads. Find the adapter and put them into the first line of the FASTQ, and use `yield` to  be memory efficient.

Day6_JoinAndFunction.py
* Convert bed format containing RNA sequences to a FASTA format, saving the bed information in the FASTA header. Use `join` and self-defined function.
