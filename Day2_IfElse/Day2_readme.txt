Aim: Solve the missing/extra input problem using if/else statement. Use internal function len(), print()
Code: Day2_IfElse.py

Some notes:
1, In python, indentation is import. If/else statement requires 4 spaces indentation
2, sys.argv is actually a list, and you can select the element in that list by 0, 1, 2â€¦ sys.argv[0] is the script name itself
    You can try to print sys.argv and see the list
3, Run the code: Day2_IfElse.py test
